      <h2>1. Personal servers and unhosted web apps</h2>

      <p>(<a href="http://unhosted.bencharp.com/">en Fran&#231;ais</a>)</p>
      <h3>Hosted software threatens software freedom</h3>
      <p>The Linux operating system and the Firefox browser have an important thing
        in common: they are free software products. They are, in a sense, owned by humankind
        as a whole. Both have played an important role in solving the situation
        that existed in the nineties, where it had become pretty much impossible to create or use
        software without paying tribute to the Microsoft monopoly which held everything in its grip.</p>        
      <p>The possibility to freely create, improve, share, and use software is called Software Freedom.
        <!-- actually, software freedom was originally defined as the freedom to use, study, share and improve,
        but i feel that 1) it has now become a relevant threat that we need to obey to some platform in order to
        publish apps (because of app store policies for instance), and 2) i don't necessarily feel that it is a
        right to study the software you are offered; you are free to not buy closed-source software, but offering
        it is not a crime. instead of complaining about closed software being closed source, we should get up off
        our arses, and we ourselves can create the software we want to create. That is why i replaced freedom to
        study with freedom to create here. -->
        It is very much comparable to for instance Freedom of Press. And as software becomes ever more important
        in our society, so does Software Freedom. We have come a long way since the free software movement was
        started, but in the last five or ten years, a new threat has come up: hosted software.</p>       
      <p>When you use your computer, some software runs on your computer, but you are also using software that
        runs on servers. Servers are computers just like the ones we use every day, but usually
        racked into large air-conditioned rooms, and stripped of their screen and keyboard, so their only interface
        is a network cable. Whenever you "go online", 
        your computer is communicating over the internet with one or more of these servers, which
        produce the things you see as websites.
        Unfortunately, most servers are controlled by powerful companies like Google, Facebook and Apple, and these
        companies have full control over most things that happen online.</p>
      <p>This means that even though you can run Linux
        and Firefox on your own computer, humankind is still not free to create, improve, share and use just any software.
        In almost everything we do with our computers, we have to go through the companies that control the hosted software
        that currently occupies most central parts
        of our global infrastructure. The companies themselves are not to blame for this, they are inanimate entities whose
        aim it is to make money by offering attractive products.
        What is failing are the non-commercial alternatives to their services.</p>
      
      <h3>One server per human</h3>
      <p>The solution to the control of hosted software over our infrastructure is quite simple: we have to decentralize the power.
        Just like freedom of press can be achieved by giving people the tools to print and distribute underground pamphlets, we
        can give people their freedom of software back by teaching them to control their own server.</p>        
      <p>Building an operating system like Linux, or a browser like Firefox is quite hard, and it took some of the world's best software
        engineers many years to achieve this. But building a web server which each human can choose to use for their online software needs
        is not hard at all: from an engineering perspective, it is a solved problem. The real challenge is organizational.</p>
        
      <h3>The network effect</h3>
      <p>A lot of people are actually working on software for "personal servers" like this. Many of them already have functional products. You
        can go to one of these projects right now, follow the install instructions for their personal server software, and you will have your own
        personal server, independent
        from any of the hosted software monopolies. But there are several reasons why not many people do this yet.
        They all have to do with the network effect.</p>
      <p>First, there is the spreading of effort, thinned out across many unrelated projects. But this has not stopped most of these projects
        from already publishing something that works. So let's say you choose the personal server software from project X, you install it, and run it.</p>
      <p>Then we get to the second problem: if I happen to run the software from project Y, and I now want to communicate with you, then
        this will only work if these two projects have taken the effort of making their products compatible with each other.</p>
      <p>Luckily, again, in practice most of these personal server projects are aware of this need, and cooperate to develop standard protocols
        that describe how servers should interact with each other. But these protocols often cover only a portion of the functionality that these
        personal
        servers have, and also, they often lead to a lot of discussion and alternative versions. This means that there are now effectively groups
        of personal server projects. So your server and my server no longer have to run exactly the same software
        in order to understand each other,
        but their software now has to be from the same group of projects.</p>
      <p>But the fourth problem is probably bigger than all the previous ones put together:
        since at present only early adopters run their own servers, chances are that you
        want to communicate with the majority of other people, who are (still) using the hosted software platforms from web 2.0's big monopolies.
        With the notable exception of <a href="http://friendica.com/">Friendica</a>,<!-- are they still the only exception? let me know if not! :) --> most personal server projects
        do not really provide a way to switch to them without your friends also
        switching to a server from the same group of projects.</p>
      
      <h3>Simple servers plus unhosted apps</h3>
      <p>So how can we solve all those problems? There are too many different applications to choose from, and we have reached a situation where
        choosing which application you want to use dictates, through all these manifestations of the network effect, which people you will be able
        to communicate with. The answer, or at least the answer we propose in this blog series, is to move the application out of the server,
        and into the browser.</p>
      <p>Browsers are now very powerful environments, not just for viewing web pages, but actually for running entire software applications.
        We call these "unhosted web applications", because they are not hosted on a server, yet they are still web applications, and not desktop
        applications, because they are written in html, css and javascript, and they can only run inside a browser's execution environment.</p>
        <!-- actually i should say "inside the web runtime", because there are now web runtimes for which it is no longer accurate to call them
        web browsers, but i felt that that became too complicated to explain here -->
      <p>Since we move all the application features out of the personal server and into the browser, the actual personal server becomes very
        simple. It is basically reduced to a gateway that can broker connections between unhosted web apps and the outside world. And if an incoming
        message arrives while the user is not online with any unhosted web app, it can queue it up and keep it safe until the next time the user
        connects.</p>
      <p>Unhosted web apps also lack a good place to store valuable user data, and servers are good for that. So apart from brokering our connections
        with the outside world, the server can also function as cloud storage for unhosted web apps. This makes sure your data is safe if your device
        is broken or lost, and also lets you easily synchronize data between multiple devices. We developed the
        <a href="http://remotestorage.io">remoteStorage</a> protocol for this, which we recently submitted as an IETF Internet Draft.</p>
      
      <p>The unhosted web apps we use can be independent of our personal server. They can come from any trusted source, and can be running in our browser
        without the need to choose a specific application at the time of choosing and installing the personal server software. This
        separation of concerns is what ultimately allows people to freely choose:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Which personal server you run</li>
        <li>Which application you want to use today</li>
        <li>Who you interact with</li>
      </ul> 
    
      <h3>No Cookie Crew</h3>
      <p>This blog is the official handbook of a group of early adopters of unhosted web apps called the No Cookie Crew. We call ourselves that because
        we have disabled all cookies in our browser, including first-party cookies.
        We configure our browser to only make an exception for a handful of "second party" cookies.
        To give an example: if you publish something "on" Twitter, then Twitter acts as a third party, because they, as a
        company, are not the intended audience. But if you send a user support question to Twitter, then you are communicating "with" them, as a second
        party. Other examples of second-party interactions are online banking, online check-in at an airline website, or buying an ebook from Amazon.
        But if you are logging in to eBay to buy an electric guitar from a guitar dealer, then eBay is more a third party in that interaction.</p>
      <p>There are situations where going through a third party is unavoidable, for instance if a certain guitar dealer only sells on eBay, or a certain
        friend of yours only posts on Facebook. For each of these "worlds", we will develop application-agnostic gateway modules that we can add to our
        personal server. Usually this will require having a "puppet" account in that world, which this gateway module can control. Sometimes, it is
        necessary to use an API key before your personal server can connect to control your "puppet", but these are usually easy to obtain. To the people
        in each world, your puppet will look just like any other user account in there. But the gateway module on your personal server allows unhosted
        web apps to control it, and to "see" what it sees.</p>
      <p>In no case will we force other people to change how they communicate with us. Part of the goal of this exercise is to show that it is possible
        to completely log out of web 2.0 without having to lose contact with anybody who stays behind.</p>
      <p>To add to the fun, we also disabled Flash, Quicktime, and other proprietary plugins, and will not use any desktop apps.</p>
      <p>Whenever we have to violate these rules, we make a note of it, and try to learn from it. And before you ask, at this moment, the No Cookie Crew
        still has only one member: me. :) Logging out of web 2.0 is still pretty much a full-time occupation, because most things you do require a
        script that you have to write, upload and run first. But if that sounds like fun to you, you are very much invited to join! Otherwise, you can
        also just watch from a distance by following this blog.</p>
     
      <h3>This blog</h3>
      <p>Each blog post in this series will be written like a tutorial, including code snippets, so that you can follow along with the unhosted web apps
        and personal server tools in your own browser and on your own server. We will mainly be using nodejs on the server-side. We will publish one
        episode every Tuesday. As we build up material and discuss various topics, we will be building up the official Handbook of the No Cookie Crew.
        Hopefully, any web enthusiast, even if you haven't taken the leap yet to join
        the No Cookie Crew, will find many relevant and diverse topics discussed here, and food for thought. We will start off next week by building an
        unhosted text editor from scratch. It is the editor I am using right now to write this, and it is indeed an unhosted web app:
        it is not hosted on any server.</p>
      <p>For two years already our research on unhosted web apps is fully funded by donations from
        <a href="/thankyou.html">many awesome
          and generous people</a>, as well as several companies and foundations. This blog series is a write-up of all the
        tricks and insights we discovered so far.</p>

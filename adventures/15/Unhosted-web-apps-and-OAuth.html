      <h2>15. Unhosted web apps and OAuth</h2>

<!-- unhosted oauth: Unhosted web apps and OAuth. -->
<h3>The unhosted approach to OAuth</h3>
<p>OAuth is a very important recent development on the open web, and maybe partially because of that, also a
  <a href="http://tech.slashdot.org/story/13/03/22/1439235/a-truckload-of-oauth-issues-that-would-make-any-author-quit">troubled</a> one.</p>
<p>Making hosted applications interact with each other in such a way that the user understands the security model is hard. Many casual users of the web don't
  understand what a server is, so it's not easy to explain to them that two instead of one servers will now have access to their data, and what that means.</p>
<p>In this episode of the handbook, we're going to help make the confusion even worse. :) We're going to use unhosted applications to interact with the APIs of hosted ones.</p>

<h3>Terms of Service</h3>
<p>One of the reasons that hosted software presents a fundamental 
  <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve">violation</a>
  of software freedom is that the user needs to agree to terms of service which are often
unreasonable. Even
though we are creating unhosted software that can replace most hosted software, hosted applications will likely still exists for some time to come, so
we set up a project where we review the terms of service of all the big hosted applications, and rate them for how well they respect consumer rights. It's called
  <a href="http://tosdr.org/">Terms of Service; Didn't Read</a>, and is now an independent project with its own donations budget, run by community of volunteers, and a team
  led by Hugo.</p>
<p>To make the reviewing process easier, we decided we want to build a web form that directly creates pull requests on the github repo of the website. The tosdr.org website
is made up of html, generated from json files using a build script. Previously, it was an unhosted web app that dynamically rendered the views from JSON data,
  but since this was slow to load in most browsers, and the prominent
use case for the website is to access the reviews as read-only documents, we moved the scripts into the build script. The site is now almost entirely static; it is hosted
as static content on 5apps, and you just click through the content without much javascript getting executed.</p>
<p>This means it's not currently possible to edit the website without using a git client. In fact,
  contributing to ToS;DR (both editing the website and participating in comment threads) requires me to log in to github, where both the code and the issue tracker are
  hosted. So far in the preceding episodes we have 
  discussed how to give up hosted applications like GMail, Facebook, Flickr and Twitter, and how to give up native applications like Skype and Spotify, but github is still
  a platform we rely on every day in the life of an unhosted web app developer.</p>

<h3>Cross-origin access to github</h3>
<p>Github exposes an API with which you can do, by the looks of it, everything you can do via its web and git interfaces. For instance, you can create a blob, create a commit,
  and create a pull request to suggest a change to the code in a github repo. This is exactly what we need for tosdr.org.</p>
<p>At first I started adding github as a platform to sockethub, but later I realised that if we use a non-branded OAuth client, plus the 
  <a href="https://blog.5apps.com/2013/03/02/new-service-cors-ssl-proxy.html">5apps cors proxy</a>, then we don't need anything else. It is possible to access github from an
  unhosted web app, without using sockethub. If you mirror the app, you would use your own cors proxy of course, and we should probably allow users to configure a cors proxy
  of their choice at runtime, but for now, we are trusting 5apps, who already host tosdr.org's source code anyway, to also host the cors proxy for it.
  Let me explain how it works.</p>
<p>In order to access the github API, you need to register an app. This gives you a client_id and a client_secret. The
  <a href="http://developer.github.com/guides/basics-of-authentication/">documentation</a> says you should never, ever, publish your client secret. The name 'client secret'
  also obviously implies this. :) However, this is part of a security model where a hosted application gets access to github. The word 'client' here refers to the second
  hosted application being a client when connecting to the github API.</p>
<p>Some APIs, like for instance the <a href="http://developers.flattr.net/api/">Flattr API</a>, offer cross-origin access, using the same technique as remoteStorage:
  OAuth 
  <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.2">implicit grant</a> flow to obtain a bearer token, and then CORS headers on the API responses to allow cross-origin ajax from the client-side.</p>
<p>Whereas Flattr supports the implicit grant flow like intended by the authors of the OAuth spec, Dropbox offers OAuth 1.0, and 
  <a href="https://tech.dropbox.com/2012/08/some-love-for-javascript-applications-2/">suggests</a> you publish your client secret.
  Github tells you not to expose your client secret, but does not provide a reason for that.
  I asked them about this, and they replied that this enables them to rate limit and
  block malicious traffic on a per-app basis. It basically turns hosted apps into gatekeepers that stand in between the user and the API.</p>
<p>In order to stop a third party from pretending to be us, I used an anonymous app registration, in a github account that I created specifically for this purpose
  naming the app after its redirect URL. The user
  is redirected to our web form on tosdr.org when they authorize the app, so I think most attack vectors will be pretty unrealistic, but at least by not using the
  official "tosdr" github user for the app
  registration, we can be sure that the value of the secret is no larger than what an attacker could just register themselves by creating a new github user.</p>
<p>At first, the redirect will provide an access code, which still has to be exchanged for an access token. We do this as follows, using the 5apps CORS proxy. Note that
  despite the fact that github says you should never, ever do this, I put the client secret into the client-side code:
<pre><code>
  var githubClient = {
    id: '3365a610f873704cff3a',
    secret: 'e9b3c5161bf15a2518046e95d64efc880afcfc58',
    proxy1: 'https://cors.5apps.com/?uri=https://github.com',
    proxy2: 'https://cors.5apps.com/?uri=https://api.github.com'
  };
  function post(path, payload, cb) {
    var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xhr.open('POST', githubClient.proxy1+path, true);
    xhr.setRequestHeader('Content-Type',
        'application/x-www-form-urlencoded');
    xhr.setRequestHeader('Content-Length', payload.length);
    xhr.onload = function () {
      console.log(xhr.status);
      console.log(xhr.responseText);
    }
    xhr.send(payload);
  }
  function extractParam(key) {
    var pairs = location.search.substring(1).split('&amp;');
    for(var i=0; i&gt;pairs.length; i++) {
      var kv = pairs[i].split('=');
      if(decodeURIComponent(kv[0])==key) {
        return decodeURIComponent(kv[1]);
      }
    }
  }
  function codeToToken() {
    var code = extractParam('code');
    if(code) {
      post('/login/oauth/access_token',
        'client_id='+githubClient.id
        +'&amp;client_secret='+githubClient.secret
        +'&amp;code='+code, function(){
      });
    }
  }
  codeToToken();
</code></pre>
<p>I haven't written the code for the whole pull request creation yet, but at least the access to github is working with this.
  It might be a bit of a hack, and in general you should of course never expose secrets, but in this case it is empowering unhosted web apps,
  and resolves a dependency on hosted server-side software, so I think it's justified whenever the preferable
  <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.2">implicit grant</a> flow is not being offered. But please
  <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/unhosted/j3QAL4msUyo">comment</a> if you think this type of hack is harmful in any way.</p>
